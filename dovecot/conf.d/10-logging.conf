# Format to use for logging mail deliveries:
#  %$ - Delivery status message (e.g. "saved to INBOX")
#  %m / %{msgid} - Message-ID
#  %s / %{subject} - Subject
#  %f / %{from} - From address
#  %p / %{size} - Physical size
#  %w / %{vsize} - Virtual size
#  %e / %{from_envelope} - MAIL FROM envelope
#  %{to_envelope} - RCPT TO envelope
#  %{delivery_time} - How many milliseconds it took to deliver the mail
#  %{session_time} - How long LMTP session took, not including delivery_time
#  %{storage_id} - Backend-specific ID for mail, e.g. Maildir filename
